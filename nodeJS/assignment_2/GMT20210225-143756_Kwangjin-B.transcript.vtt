00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.300
Kwangjin Baek: hello, my name is Jim back and i'm going to start demonstrating my assignment here i'm going to start with the fires.

2
00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:17.820
Kwangjin Baek: I have images folder which has a faff con and html js and to CSS fires.

3
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:28.260
Kwangjin Baek: CSS files have styres main for general style and table for invoice table.

4
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:49.410
Kwangjin Baek: There is nothing much in the CSS files, but they have a crisis that manipulate the display status of each field right this one, for example, this will hide the invoice table when it when the application first runs.

5
00:00:52.680 --> 00:01:00.060
Kwangjin Baek: And by the movie by removing this class, I will be able to show the inverse table there.

6
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:09.690
Kwangjin Baek: And for the html I have main form at the top and invoice table at the bottom.

7
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.480
Kwangjin Baek: And if I go to the coding.

8
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.730
Kwangjin Baek: I have a duty of a delay expressions at the top.

9
00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.380
Kwangjin Baek: Because I have a duty pattern check.

10
00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.820
Kwangjin Baek: And I have some barriers to check if there was an adder or not this.

11
00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:47.970
Kwangjin Baek: error control array will check if there was an error initiative and based on the desert desert of this array this is their error boolean will be set to either true or false.

12
00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:51.720
Kwangjin Baek: And by the way, by default.

13
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.960
Kwangjin Baek: They are set invalid.

14
00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:06.390
Kwangjin Baek: and on on and in on summit event handler I have a statement and for that for iteration.

15
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:32.490
Kwangjin Baek: For iteration is to check if there was an error in error control Ray and if statement is for checking the is their error boolean so if there are valid valid in place order function will be court.

16
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:50.160
Kwangjin Baek: Basically what it does, is that it will hide the main phone and show the invoice table with the information that a user has put in.

17
00:02:54.540 --> 00:03:04.320
Kwangjin Baek: For the concatenation and calculation i'm going to demonstrate it by learning the application later.

18
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.750
Kwangjin Baek: It has a switch statement.

19
00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:23.850
Kwangjin Baek: To get the value by the fear the name for the delivery charge and province our provincial tax and if I go back to the top again.

20
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:30.240
Kwangjin Baek: I have this on improved event handler which will check.

21
00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:36.900
Kwangjin Baek: If it's valid or not whenever there is an input.

22
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:40.080
Kwangjin Baek: So.

23
00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.520
Kwangjin Baek: 30 rows at the top, is for.

24
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:50.040
Kwangjin Baek: validation for require the fear is.

25
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.930
Kwangjin Baek: So if I call this function.

26
00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.400
Kwangjin Baek: If there is, if it's empty.

27
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:04.140
Kwangjin Baek: It will English English or the error message.

28
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:06.510
Kwangjin Baek: And it is not.

29
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:17.670
Kwangjin Baek: It is show the belly to belly the message and if I go into this function show in Berlin and chauvin it, these are.

30
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.150
Kwangjin Baek: main functions that control.

31
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:28.830
Kwangjin Baek: The flow of this whole operation.

32
00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.410
Kwangjin Baek: What I mean by that is.

33
00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:34.530
Kwangjin Baek: it's valid either set.

34
00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:44.430
Kwangjin Baek: The value in the Arab country or a to either one or general.

35
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:52.110
Kwangjin Baek: And either set or the error messages or messages.

36
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.530
Kwangjin Baek: So these functions.

37
00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:01.680
Kwangjin Baek: A chord in almost every function.

38
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.390
Kwangjin Baek: And these are.

39
00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.390
Kwangjin Baek: For the parent check.

40
00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.160
Kwangjin Baek: I have a use the switch statement.

41
00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:23.910
Kwangjin Baek: To decide.

42
00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:25.770
Kwangjin Baek: Which pattern.

43
00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:29.430
Kwangjin Baek: Depending on the fear the name.

44
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:39.690
Kwangjin Baek: And these fears are also required the fields, so it has an STD statement so.

45
00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:43.620
Kwangjin Baek: it's not empty it a check the pattern.

46
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.430
Kwangjin Baek: And this one.

47
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:51.480

53
00:06:20.940 --> 00:06:32.490
Kwangjin Baek: But if I start typing in something it a check if it's valid or not, because I have used input event handler.

54
00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:35.820
Kwangjin Baek: and

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:44.940
